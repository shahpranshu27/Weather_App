# Weather_App

Heyy everyone, So, I have tried to implement my learnings, and have made a very small project, which is Weather Application.

So, I have been learning Java, JSP, Servlet since a month now, and I really wanted to put all this togeather, and create any basic level project, to test my knowledge.... And here it is!!

Though it seem very basic and nothing at all, the backend part was quite challenging and fun for me to be honest. 

I'll keep making such small and mid level projects to test my knowledge!
